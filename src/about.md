# About

This is a template (or demo) for integrating [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) with Eleventy. This allows you to use Vite for its very fast bundling of JS and assets for client-side scripts, while building the static pages (and anything related) with Eleventy.

This main branch uses plain JS, as well as the Vite plugin for legacy scripts. To check out other possibilities (react, react with typescript), check out the branches of this repository.
